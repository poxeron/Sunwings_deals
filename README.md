This script will prove useful for adventurers who are ready to choose Sunwing as their service provider.

The main script "parsing_Sunwing_json.py" parses a direct URL with json data and is located in the "Sunwing" folder.
the script using BS4 and DOM parsing is not finished yet and I'm not sure if I need to complete it since I already have a working version.
Let's get a look.

By default, the CSV file containing the data will be created in the same directory where the script is located or the executable is run.

Also added examples of result:
regular csv file and excel file with pivot tables.
